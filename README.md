# VideoConverter
a simple video converter

1. Why?
So sometimes I need to edit some videos. My phone records videos with weird codec,
so I can't use in video editor program. I needed to convert my files and I used some online converters
but it took a lot of time. Some of them even asked me to pay for conversion after I waited 30 minutes for upload.

I got angry and I made this.

2. What is it?
A video converter using free softwere called FFmpeg. I made a simple gui and you can use if you want.
